        "* Both can be iterated over with loops\n",

        "\n",
        "Differences:\n",
        "* NumPy arrays can only hold one data type (i.e. floats or ints), whereas Lists can hold mixed data types (floats, ints, strings, etc.) in the same list. This fact means NumPy arrays use less computer memory.\n",
        "* NumPy arrays cannot be extended after they are created. Their length is fixed.\n",
        "* They have built-in vectorized operations that allow calculations on all elements without for loops (see below)\n",
        "* NumPy arrays contain lots of built-in mathematical functions written in C (and are thus fast) for linear algebra, statistics, reshaping, etc.\n",
        "* NumPy arrays can be 2D, 3D, 4D, etc. for higher-dimensional calculations\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bottom Line:  Use NumPy arrays instead of Python Lists when you need to perform mathematical calculations, need multidimensional support or want access to NumPy merthods and functionality.**\n",

        "NumPy arrays can be used to store any sequence of numbers. Here are some examples of the many ways they might be used:\n",
        "* To store vector components in 2D, 3D, 4D, etc. space. Each element of the array represents a vector component in space\n",
        "* To store multiple measurements of the same variable\n",
