        "# P3 Motion of a Charged Particle in Magnetic Dipole Field\n",
        "\n",
        "It is well known that a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field will spiral around the magnetic field lines. Write Python code to simulate the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic dipole field (which approximates the Earth's magnetic field).  Draw the Earth as a sphere in 3D space and draw an example trajectory of a charged particle. Choose the mass, charge and compoments of the initial velocity of the particle wisely so the motion spirals around the field line. Start the particle a given distance away from the dipole and calculate the magnetic field at that point. Then, choose a vector velocity so that it will sprial around the local field with a radius of curvature much less than the distance to the dipole. Use this initial velocity in your simulation. Analyze the motion of the charged particle."
