        "\n",
        "The built-in numerical integrator in the SciPy library is called `solve_ivp()` which stands for \"Solve Initial Value Problem\". It offers multiple integration methods for ODEs with different properties. In this tutorial we will explore one of the most widely-used integration methods:  RK45, an adaptive time-step method that uses 4th and 5th order Runge Kutta schemes.\n",
        "\n",
        "On each timestep, the RK45 method solves the ODE using both a 4th and a 5th order Runge Kutta method. It then calculates the difference between the solutions, call it $\\epsilon = |y_{n+1}(RK4) -y_{n+1}(RK5)|$. If $\\epsilon > atol + rtol\\cdot |y_n|$, then it reduces the time step and recalculates the error. Once the error is within the acceptable tolerance, the method advances to the next timestep. It also has a method for expanding the time step when the error is too small. The result is a method that can reduce the size of the timestep when the solution is rapidy changing and increase the timestep when the solution is slowly varying. This approach can vastly speed up the integration while preserving accuracy.\n",
