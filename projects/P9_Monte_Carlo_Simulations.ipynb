        "(a) Write python code to estimate the value of $\\pi$ by randomly throwing darts at a square and counting the number of darts that inside a circle inscribed in the square. Create an example plot showing the square, circle and simulated dart throws (as points). Also create a plot showing how the $\\pi$ approximation approaches the true value of $\\pi$ as a function of the number of throws. How many hypothetical darts do you need to throw to approximate $\\pi$ to 2 decimal places?\n",
        "\n",
        "(b) Write a second program for estimating $\\pi$ using Buffon's needle problem (Google or ChatGPT it). In this example, needles of length $L$ are dropped on a a floor made of parallel strips of wood with the same width $L$. The value of $\\pi$ may be calculated by counting the numer of needles that fall across the line between two wooden strips. Again, plot an example showing a sample of needles and vertical lines.  Create plots to visualize each example. How many hypothetical needles do you need to throw to approximate $\\pi$ to 2 decimal places?"
