        "The heat equation is a partial differential equation describing how internal energy is distributed across an object. Use python to solve the heat equation on a square. Maintain the left and right sides of the square at a temperature T1 and the top and bottom sides of the square at a temperature T2 (this is called a Dirichlet boundary condition). Solve for the distribution of the internal energy across the square as a function of time. Plot the distribution as a heat map at three different times. Modify your code to implement a Newmann boundary condition along the top and bottom sides of the square. Again, solve for the distribution of the internal energy across the square as a function of time. Plot the distribution as a heat map at three different times. Describe what your code is doing and what you can learn about the underlying physics."
