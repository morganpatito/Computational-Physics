        "In a thermal system, we have many atoms and molecules exchanging energy with each other via mutual interactions in order to reach equilibrium. To mimic such a system, let us play a thought money-swap game among N people in the room. Everyone starts with 10 gold coins. The rules are: In each turn, we randomly select a person (say Amy) to give a coin to another randomly-selected person (say Bob). If Amy has coins in her possession, she gives one to Bob. If Amy has no coins, do nothing. Repeat the turns many times. What is the wealth distribution (number of coins each person has) in the end?\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a Python code to simulate this process. Start with a grid of NxN points, each with 10 gold coins. follow the rules above. Plot an image showing the number of gold coins across the grid along with a histogram showing the probability that a given person has a given number of coins. Show these plots a several times as the system approaches thermal equilibruim.\n",

        "Compare the histogram with the Boltzmann distribution. This model is an approximation to the Einstein model of solids. What can you learn about the underlying physics using this simulation?"
